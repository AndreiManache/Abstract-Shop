# Abstract-Shop
Abstract Shop

This is my first project as a front-end developer. In creating it i used HTML , CSS and JavaScript.
I used a bootstrap library to make it responsive. I used firebase for storing my data and made fetch calls on it so
the site loads its content directly from there. In the admin section you can add , modify or delete the products directly from the database.
The cart stores it's products in the localStorage so they dont disapear when you hit refresh.
In making the site responsive I also used a 2 media queries and the entire css is positioning the elements and usig flexbox and many 
more properties so that the project looks to it's best.
